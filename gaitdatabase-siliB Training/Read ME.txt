Additional explanations:
I, Mahdi Dor Emami had just simulated the chapter 6 of this thesis for my own investigation and have not yet did any
other research or projects to site this papre.

I also used Spyder to write the codes. After all, the sectioning capability is a superior advantage rather than Sublime Text3.
